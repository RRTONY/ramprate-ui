              70-90% of mergers and acquisitions fail to achieve their stated
              synergy targets. The reason isn't financial — it's human. When you
              merge two organizations, you're merging two circuits. And if you
              don't understand the wiring of each one, you're not integrating —
              you're colliding.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              The Flow Circuit provides a diagnostic framework that maps the
              human wiring of both organizations before, during, and after the
              merger — so you can predict where the organ rejection will happen
              and prevent it.
