const questions: Question[] = [
  {
    id: 1,
    question: "What is the single most important outcome this project must achieve?",
    why: "If you can't answer this in one sentence, you don't have a project — you have a wish list. This question forces the Spark to crystallize the vision into something the relay can actually carry.",
    flowCircuitConnection: "This is the Spark's moment. The answer to this question IS the baton. If the Spark can't define it, the Amplifier has nothing to amplify.",
    role: "Spark",
    followUp: "Can you say it in 10 words or fewer? If not, you're not ready to start.",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "Who needs to hear about this — and who needs to believe it?",
    why: "Ideas don't die because they're bad. They die because they never reach the right ears. This question identifies the Amplifier's target audience and the resistance they'll face.",
    flowCircuitConnection: "The Amplifier's job isn't just to spread the word — it's to make the right people believe. This question maps the amplification strategy.",
    role: "Amplifier",
    followUp: "List three people who must be convinced. Now list what each one is afraid of.",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "What assumptions are we making that could kill this project?",
    why: "Every project is built on assumptions. Most of them are invisible. This question is the Filter's superpower — surfacing the hidden assumptions before they become hidden failures.",
    flowCircuitConnection: "The Filter doesn't just check quality — they check assumptions. This is the question that separates 'refinement' from 'rubber stamping.'",
    role: "Filter",
    followUp: "For each assumption, ask: 'What would we do differently if this assumption were wrong?'",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "What does 'done' look like — specifically?",
    why: "If the team can't agree on what 'done' looks like, they'll never agree on whether they got there. This question gives the Ground a clear finish line.",
    flowCircuitConnection: "The Ground can't execute without a definition of done. This question is the contract between the Spark's vision and the Ground's reality.",
    role: "Ground",
    followUp: "Write the 'done' criteria as a checklist. If you can't check it off, it's not a criterion — it's a feeling.",
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "Who is responsible for each handoff in this project?",
    why: "Projects don't fail in the middle of a task. They fail in the gaps between tasks — the handoffs. This question maps the relay and identifies where batons will be dropped.",
    flowCircuitConnection: "This is the Conductor's question. Every unnamed handoff is a dropped baton waiting to happen. The Conductor's job is to name every one of them.",
    role: "Conductor",
    followUp: "For each handoff, name the person giving the baton AND the person catching it. If either is 'TBD,' you have a gap.",
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "What will we say no to?",
    why: "Scope creep kills more projects than bad ideas. This question forces the team to define boundaries before the pressure to expand begins.",
    flowCircuitConnection: "The Filter's second superpower: saying no. A project without boundaries is a project without a Filter. And a project without a Filter ships garbage.",
    role: "Filter",
    followUp: "Write down three things that are explicitly OUT of scope. Post them where everyone can see them.",
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "What's the fastest way to prove this won't work?",
    why: "Most teams spend months building something before testing the core assumption. This question inverts the process — kill the bad idea fast so you can find the good one.",
    flowCircuitConnection: "This is the 'Getting to No Faster' principle. The Conductor's job is to accelerate disqualification so the team's energy flows to what actually works.",
    role: "Conductor",
    followUp: "Design a 48-hour test that would disprove your core assumption. If you can't, your assumption might be untestable — which is its own problem.",
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "Who on this team has done something like this before?",
    why: "Experience isn't just about skill — it's about pattern recognition. Someone who's been through a similar relay before can spot the dropped batons before they hit the floor.",
    flowCircuitConnection: "The Ground's experience is the team's insurance policy. If nobody has done this before, you need more Filter time and more Conductor oversight.",
    role: "Ground",
    followUp: "If the answer is 'nobody,' that's not a disqualifier — but it means you need to budget for learning curves and build in more checkpoints.",
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: "What does this project need that we don't have?",
    why: "Honesty about gaps is more valuable than optimism about strengths. This question surfaces the missing pieces before they become missing deadlines.",
    flowCircuitConnection: "This is the circuit health check. Missing a role? Missing a skill? Missing a resource? Name it now or discover it at the worst possible moment.",
    role: "Spark",
    followUp: "For each gap, decide: do we build it, buy it, or borrow it? And who's responsible for closing the gap?",
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    question: "If this project succeeds, what changes — and for whom?",
    why: "The ultimate question. If you can't articulate the impact, you can't justify the effort. This question connects the project back to the 'why' that started it.",
    flowCircuitConnection: "This is where the relay comes full circle. The Spark ignited it, the Amplifier spread it, the Filter refined it, the Ground built it — and now the Conductor asks: did it matter?",
    role: "Conductor",
    followUp: "Write the success story as if it already happened. If it doesn't excite you, the project isn't worth the relay.",
  },
